RETURN TO TRADEMEET ITEM PACK

Author: al47 <http://www.shsforums.net/index.php?showtopic=15702>

If the "special" store of Ribald (Adventure's Mart, Waukeen Promenade, after Spellhold) isn't enough for you,
expand it with 51 new magic items!



In order to let French and German gamers enjoy this mod, we repackaged it and included the translations.
Of course, we'll take it down as soon as either al17 updates the mod or asks for it to be taken down.
